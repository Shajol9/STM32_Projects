# STM32 Projects
## Description
This repository contains basic projects for learning embedded programming with STM32 MCUs. Most of the scripts are written targeting the STM32F3DISCOVERY board, but they can easily be modified to work on other STM32 MCU boards. All scripts are bare metal scripts. This is an evolving repository, so more projects and content will continuously be added.

## Table of Content
1. LED_toglling_using_structures_and_bitfields
2. LED_On
3. gpio_input_configuration

### LED_toglling_using_structures_and_bitfields
This project showcases the use of structures and bitfields to abstract a simple script that periodically turns on a user LED.  

### LED_On
A simple script to turn on USER LEDs on the STM32F3DISCOVERY board.

### gpio_input_configuration
A script written to interface the onboard user pushbutton as an input to turn on the user LED and blink it in a specific pattern. 

## Other scripts
There are a few more fun practice scripts in this repository written in Embedded C.
